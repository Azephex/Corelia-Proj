The Project involves highlighting underrated female composers and allowing the general public to find and discover special music that might otherwise go unnoticed. 
The solution involves creating a web application with innovative implementations that bolsters its ease of use and perfectly showcases composers, instrumentalists and their musical compositions. 
Some innovations we have employed have to do with the fact that usability and accessibility have been taken to the forefront allowing any user to browse the website efficiently, while employing data visualisation techniques to simplify the processing aspect of the website for the client. 
Furthermore, data analysis techniques are used throughout the website with implementations like the dashboard allowing our client to have a better understanding of the web application and its performance. 
Security and Authentication will also receive attention as they bolster the overall safety of the website and its users. All of these aspects form a strong foundation that not only provides our client with the much-needed agency and control, it is also relatively future-proof ,which can sustain our web solution for an extended amount of time.
